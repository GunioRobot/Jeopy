1. Name server startup:
   make ServerLauncher spawn a new thread with the name server before GUI startup.

2. Plot rendering:
   generate plot only once in the ServerGui worker thread and deepcopy it to clients. This way, clients don't all redraw the same plot redundantely.

3. Remove Unban button from LoginDialog.

4. Create blacklist when pressing Ban button in Logindialog.

5. Test:
   - on Ubuntu 10.10 to find out what dependencies are called.
   - on Mac OS X 10.6 (w/32bit kernel) and packages compiled from macports. Currently, a SIGSEGV may randomly occur when pushing a button.
     Backtrace indicates problem somewhere in SIP/PyQt bindings as far as I can tell.
     Adding osx.backtrace to record issue.
