Requires:
	- Python > 2.6
	- PyQt > 4.6
	- Pyro ~ 3.10 (NOT Pyro 4)
	- Matplotlib

Running:

	- You need to start the Pyro Name Server by yourself
	  this is operating system and path dependent so I
	  have not done that in code. Perhaps before final
	  revision.

	  Do so, by running 'pyro-ns' in UNIX and 'pyro-ns.cmd'
	  in Windows, which is probably located in the Tools/Scripts
	  directory of your Python distribution root.

	  For UNIX, you can also start the server by running
	  'python ServerLauncher.py' which whill start the nameserver
	  automatically.
	  
	- First, run the game server and select a .jeop file. Do this
	  by running 'python ServerGui.py'.

	- Any client can only start after a game has been selected and
	the login table has been displayed in the server gui. Clients
	can be started by running 'python PlayerGui.py'.
