	- use netifaces
	- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/netifaces/0.4
	netifaces.ifaddresses('vmnet8')[netifaces.AF_INET][0]['addr']

Requires:
	- Python > 2.6
	- PyQt > 4.6
	- Pyro ~ 3.10 (NOT Pyro 4)
	- Matplotlib

For Ubuntu 10.10, install [sud apt-get install ...]:
    	- python-qt4
	- pyro
	- python-matplotlib
	- python-netifaces (soon...)

For Mac OS X [10.5+], install [sudo port install ...]:
    	! The python interpreted from MacPorts is required to run this program.
	! You can find it in /opt/local/bin/python2.6.
	! To use it by default, set /opt/local/bin before /usr/bin in your PATH
	! Create a symlink named python in /opt/local/bin to the python2.6 binary
    	- py26-pyqt4
	- py26-pyro
	- py26-matplotlib

For Windows, install:
    	- ?

Running:

	- You need to start the Pyro Name Server by yourself
	  this is operating system and path dependent so I
	  have not done that in code. Perhaps before final
	  revision.

	  Do so, by running 'pyro-ns' in UNIX and 'pyro-ns.cmd'
	  in Windows, which is probably located in the Tools/Scripts
	  directory of your Python distribution root.


	- First, run the game server and select a .jeop file. Do this
	  by running 'python AdminGui.py' or './AdminGui.py' if the program
	  is executable.

	- Any client can only start after a game has been selected and
	the login table has been displayed in the server gui. Clients
	can be started by running 'python PlayerGui.py'.

Hacking:
	- Remember to add relevant comments! For that you need epydoc.
	http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/
	Run it with 'epydoc -v *.py'
